    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>At Creovate, our design process is simple, efficient, and collaborative. Here's how we bring your vision to life:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Consultation:</strong> We start by understanding your goals, vision, and requirements. We ask questions to ensure we capture the essence of your brand or idea.</li>
      <li><strong>Concept Development:</strong> Based on your input, we create initial design concepts. We explore various creative solutions that align with your objectives.</li>
      <li><strong>Feedback and Revisions:</strong> We value your feedback and work closely with you to refine the design. We make necessary adjustments to ensure the final product is perfect.</li>
      <li><strong>Final Delivery:</strong> Once you're happy with the design, we provide the final deliverables in the desired formats, ready for implementation.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Our goal is to make the design process seamless and enjoyable, allowing you to focus on what matters most while we take care of the creative work.</p>
